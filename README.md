# ðŸŒ¯ `Burrito Spigot` ðŸŒ¯

#Project Made by PeytonPlayz595 - Discord: PeytonPlayz595#6793

I have not had time to work on this project, but during my free time I will try to add more features:

Option to disable/enable double tallgrass generation,
More World Generation Settings (Max/Min Mountain Height, Max/Min Ore Spawn, Max/Min Cave height, tree generation settings),
Built in World Templates,
and custom server commands


This is a custom fork of [BurritoSpigot](https://github.com/CobbleSword/BurritoSpigot/) with [ProtocolSupport](https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport) 1.8, and [EaglerBungee](https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglercraft/tree/main/stable-download/java/bungee_command) for [Eaglercraft](https://g.deev.is/eaglercraft/)

# Features
- Removed double tall grass generation because [this](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zfjojyrntxfa8ai/Screenshot+2022-10-01+5.06.39+PM.png/file) happens on minecraft versions 1.6 and lower when using ProtocolSupport, What is happening here is double tall grass shows up as 2 roses because double tall grass was not added until minecraft version 1.7.
