# ðŸŒ¯ `Burrito Spigot` ðŸŒ¯

# Project Made by PeytonPlayz595

I have not had time to work on this project, but during my free time I will try to add more features:

Option to disable/enable double tallgrass generation,
More World Generation Settings (Max/Min Mountain Height, Max/Min Ore Spawn, Max/Min Cave height, tree generation settings),
Built in World Templates,
and custom server commands


This is a custom fork of [BurritoSpigot](https://github.com/CobbleSword/BurritoSpigot/) with [ProtocolSupport](https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport) 1.8, and [EaglerBungee](https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglercraft/tree/main/stable-download/java/bungee_command) for [Eaglercraft](https://g.deev.is/eaglercraft/)

# Features
- I removed double tall grass generation temporarily until I get a chance to add a feature that toggles it on/off. I removed double tall grass because it breaks on versions below 1.7
