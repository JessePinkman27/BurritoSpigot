This is a custom fork of [BurritoSpigot](https://github.com/CobbleSword/BurritoSpigot/) with [ProtocolSupport](https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport) 1.8, and [EaglerBungee](https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglercraft/tree/main/stable-download/java/bungee_command) for [Eaglercraft](https://g.deev.is/eaglercraft/)

# Features
- No double tall grass generation because [this](https://www.mediafire.com/file/zfjojyrntxfa8ai/Screenshot+2022-10-01+5.06.39+PM.png/file) happens on minecraft versions 1.6 and lower when using ProtocolSupport, What is happening here is double tall grass shows up as 2 roses because double tall grass got added until minecraft version 1.7.
